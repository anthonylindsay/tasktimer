tasktimer
=========

A way to time what you are doing.

Task Timer is a tool for people who need to keep track of the time they spend on daily tasks.

It is specifically designed with context switching in mind, so that it is easy to switch the timer from one task to another with a minimum of fuss.

How to use
-------------

- Add a timer
- Click to change the title of your timer.
- Repeat for as many timers as you need.
- Drag them about to put them in an order that makes sense to you.
- Simply click on a timer to activate it.
- The stop button stops all timers.
- A timer can be deleted at any point.
- Timers can be merged together.
- Total tracked time can be displayed/updated.
- Shift time from one timer to another.


Known Issues
--------------

This project is still enjoying ongoing development so the javascript does still need to be optimised and minified.

Roadmap
---------

- Disable timers (usecase: You've finished the task and want the display to reflect that, but don't want to delete it yet.)
- more system messages
- fix title highlight behaviour after initial click
- title autocomplete
- tabular view
- timer description
- labels
- log
